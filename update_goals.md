### Aim
Refactor the code into more of a pytorch style. 
 - Module class with forward and backward methods. Modules are composable.
 - Implement Linear, Conv2D, LayerNorm, ReLU, Sigmoid, LeakyReLU, Tanh, CrossEntropyLoss, MSELoss.
 - Optimizer class with step method.
 - Implement Adam.
 - Cifar10 classification as an example.

### Extra
Implement automatic differentiation.
 - how to build a computational graph? Tracking operations, dependencies, and gradients.
